# Cloud Resume API Challenge

This project implements a cloud-based resume using various AWS services, including AWS API Gateway, DynamoDB, Lambda functions, and Amazon S3. The goal is to create a robust and scalable resume application that can be easily updated and accessed via an API.

## Project Overview

This project allows users to host their resume in the cloud, making it accessible via a RESTful API. The resume data is stored in JSON format within DynamoDB, and changes can be made locally using a code editor like VS Code. The API is designed to fetch the resume data whenever invoked.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of the following components:

- **AWS API Gateway**: Serves as the entry point for API requests.
- **AWS Lambda**: Executes the backend logic to fetch data from DynamoDB.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Stores the resume data in JSON format.
- **Amazon S3**: Hosts the static content of the resume.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates deployment and tracks changes.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Services**:
  - API Gateway
  - Lambda Functions
  - DynamoDB
  - S3 Bucket
- **CI/CD**:
  - GitHub Actions
- **Development Tools**:
  - Visual Studio Code

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create an AWS Account
If you donâ€™t already have one, [sign up for an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/).

### 2. Set Up AWS Services
- **DynamoDB Table**: Create a DynamoDB table to store your resume in JSON format.
- **S3 Bucket**: Set up an S3 bucket to host the static content of your resume.
- **Lambda Function**: Create a Lambda function that connects API Gateway to DynamoDB.
- **API Gateway Configuration**: Configure API Gateway with a GET method to retrieve the resume data.

### 3. Configure GitHub Actions
- **Workflows Setup**: In the `.github/workflows` directory, create workflows to automate deployment and track changes.

### 4. Create Your Resume
- **JSON Document**: Use Visual Studio Code or your favourite code editor to create a JSON document for your resume and save it in your project directory.

### 5. Deploy Changes
- **Push to GitHub**: After making changes, push your updates to GitHub. The GitHub Actions pipeline will automatically deploy these changes to AWS.

## How It Works
- The resume data is populated in DynamoDB in JSON format.
- A Lambda function is created to link DynamoDB with the API Gateway.
- The API Gateway is configured with a GET method that retrieves the JSON document from DynamoDB whenever the API URL is accessed via a browser.
- Any changes made locally to the resume will be reflected in the AWS infrastructure after pushing to GitHub.

## GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions create a CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment process. This ensures that any changes made to the resume are automatically tracked and deployed to AWS, keeping the API up to date.
